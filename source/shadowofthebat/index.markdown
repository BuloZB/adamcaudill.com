Looking for the long lost ShadowOfTheBat.com? Well, it's been retired, for good this time. For some time, shadow was my personal blog / web site, yet due to loosing track of things, it expired and I lost it to a domain snatcher. Well, I've re-acquired it, and while the content of old is still there, I've decided it's best to let it fade away.

If there was something you needed from that site, [just let me know](http://adamcaudill.com/contact/), I'll send it your way as soon as I can. If you are looking for my blog, just click the '[Home](http://adamcaudill.com/)' link above to get there.

Shadow served me well, and it's good to know that the name won't be abused or misused now.
