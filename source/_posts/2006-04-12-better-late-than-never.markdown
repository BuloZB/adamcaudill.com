[![P4120003.jpg](http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4120003.thumbnail.jpg)](http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/04/P4120003.jpg) I [previously wrote](http://adamcaudill.com/2006/03/17/microsoft-visual-studio-2005-free/) about an offer for a free copy of Microsoft Visual Studio, well, mine came today. While it look it's time about getting here, it finally arrived. The book, while not the full version, is larger than I expected, and looks like it should be worth reading. I'm a bit disappointed in how soon that the discount for the [MCP](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcp/) [exam](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/exams/70-528.asp) expires, as with the schedule I have for the desktop [MCTS](http://adamcaudill.com/2006/03/25/mcts/) I don't think I'll have time to make use of it.

All in all, this is one of the best free offers I've seen Microsoft release. The offer is still open (closes the 17th), so if you've not signed up for yours - you should hurry.
