I've always been a big fan of the Microsoft Mouse line, and now with Vista, a new reason: [Instant View](http://blogs.msdn.com/kamvedbrat/archive/2007/01/18/instant-viewer-in-the-new-intellipoint-software-for-windows-vista.aspx). This is a great new feature in the next version on the [IntelliPoint](http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/windowsvista/support/intellipoint.mspx) software. I've been using a bit of a [hack](http://neosmart.net/blog/2006/intellipoint-on-vista/) since I [installed](http://adamcaudill.com/2006/11/18/installing-vista/) Vista back in November. So it's nice to be using a copy of IntelliPoint that is actually supposed to work with Vista.

I've got to say, the new Instant View feature is a very nice touch, and one that I really prefer to [Aero](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/experiences/aero.mspx)'s Flip 3D (Windows+Tab) feature (Instant View has a fair bit less lag). This is really an impressive feature, though not perfect. While it does work on multi-monitor setups, Flip 3D is far more graceful about it.

Try it, I'm quite certain you'll like it.
