The [VB Team](http://blogs.msdn.com/vbteam/) has just [announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/vbteam/archive/2006/09/20/763986.aspx) the release of a [VB.NET / VB6 Interop toolkit](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/downloads/powerpacks/interopforms/default.aspx), complete with source. For those of us that work in shops that still maintain a fair number of legacy applications, this could be quite useful. Here's the description straight from Microsoft:


> _The Interop Forms Toolkit 1.0 is a free add-in that simplifies the process of displaying .NET WinForms in a Visual Basic 6 application. Instead of upgrading the entire code base, these applications can now be extended one form at a time. The goal is a phased upgrade, with production releases at the end of each iteration containing both Visual Basic 6 and Visual Basic .NET forms running in the same Visual Basic 6 process.Â _


My favorite thing about this release is the inclusion of the source code* - I always love taking a peak at how MS writes code. As a side note to all this, this is just one part of the new [Visual Basic 2005 Power Pack](http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/downloads/powerpacks/default.aspx), a collection of controls, components and add-ins - all free. This is one worth looking at.

* Note: You'll find the source if you take a look in this folder:
