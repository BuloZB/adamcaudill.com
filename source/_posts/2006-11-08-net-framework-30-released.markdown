Yup, [it's here](http://www.netfx3.com/blogs/news_and_announcements/archive/2006/11/06/.NET-Framework-3.0-has-been-released_2100_.aspx)! The next version of the .NET Framework has been released, while this isn't a major release (as not much has changed), it is a milestone. This release adds support for the WPF, or Windows Presentation Foundation, the new presentation framework that will enable a new generation of remarkable interface designs.

If you're a developer, get going and get started - this is going to be fun. :)
