> [![Microsoft Calculator Plus](http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/06/calc_plus.thumbnail.png)](http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/06/calc_plus.png)


If the default calculator included with Windows doesn't cut it for you, and you need more muscle than [Power Calculator](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx) packs, then [Microsoft Calculator Plus](http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/outreach/dnloads/calcplus.mspx) just might be for you. ThisÂ  Calculator replacement offers all the classic functionality plus quite a few new tools. Great little tool for your laptop to use when [Google Calculator](http://www.googleguide.com/calculator.html) isn't an option.

Note: For those that don't like the look, just go to "View > Classic View" to go to the more traditional style.
