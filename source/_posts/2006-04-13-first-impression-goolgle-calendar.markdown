I saw noticed an article on [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/technology/2006/04/13/google-calendar-yahoo_cx_df_0413google.html) mentioning the long rumored, [Google Calendar](http://www.google.com/calendar) , and sure enough! While I've not taken long to play with it, this, so far, seems to be very cool. I'll post more after I play with it for a while.
