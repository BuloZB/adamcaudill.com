Here is a quick read from [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/)  that all developers should read: [_Assertiveness for Software Developers_](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000752.html). Jeff brings up a great point, developers aren't assertive enough; and that ends up biting us later (I know it's bitten me a few times).

This is well worth reading, and well worth some serious thought for next time your manager hands you an impossible deadline.
