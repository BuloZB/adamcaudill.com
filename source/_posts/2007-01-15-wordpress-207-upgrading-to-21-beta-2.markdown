Well, [WordPress 2.0.7](http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/wordpress-207/) has been released, and I've upgraded this site to WordPress 2.1 Beta 2.

I was excepting a rather painful upgrade; not so much because it is a beta, but the rather large number of changes. After a couple simple tweaks to my custom theme, within 10 minutes it was up and running perfectly. Knowing the effort and quality the WordPress team puts out, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.

So far it looks all is working quite well. If you see anything wrong, or just seems odd, please leave a comment so I can look into it.

I'll be posting a mini-review of WordPress 2.1 here in a couple days.
