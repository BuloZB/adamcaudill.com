I just completed doing something I said I never would, I switched from [The Bat!](http://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/thebat/) to Outlook. While I'll remain a big fan of The Bat! for its great features, using it at home, while using Outlook at work was just driving me up the wall. The two clients are about as opposite as two programs can be. The very concept behind how you use them, and how you organize you data is quite different.

Over the course of the last week, I've completed moving almost 20,000 emails into Outlook, then creating nearly 100 filters to organize it all again. This was a somewhat painful experience, but I can certainly appreciate some of the features (such as sorting) that Outlook 2003 offers.
