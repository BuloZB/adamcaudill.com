The [Sandcastle](http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/default.aspx) team just announced a new toy for users of Visual Studio, the [_Power Toys for Visual Studio Pack Installer_](http://blogs.msdn.com/sandcastle/archive/2006/11/10/introducing-the-power-toys-for-visual-studio-pack-installer.aspx). This is a unified installer for the various Power Toys released; no more downloading a dozen installers to get what you want, this one does it all. If you like pushing VS to be all it can be, this is worth looking at.
