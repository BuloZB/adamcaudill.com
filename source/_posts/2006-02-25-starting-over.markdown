This is the fifth major starting-over of my personal site. This one is different though, this time I'm really starting over. Very little of what you see here is from my older sites. I felt it was time for a clean break, and this is part of it.

This is a blend of a professional & personal blog, you'll see a dynamic mix of connect (or basically: whatever strikes my fancy). This is a change from the past, where I committed to be one or the other, but not both. I'll keep this short, as there's more to be told later, but this is just to let you all know, **I'm still alive**.
