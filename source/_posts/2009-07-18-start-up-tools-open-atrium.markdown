When it comes to small business project management, [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/) by [37signals](http://www.37signals.com/) has been the king of the hill for some time. Now though, there is an exciting new player in the field: [Open Atrium](http://openatrium.com/). It's a [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) based open source project management system somewhat like Basecamp, though with many more features.

Open Atrium is new on the scene, with beta 1 being released just 4 days ago - though it's already rather polished and seems to work well. While there are some hiccups with the installer and a disappointing lack of documentation, it's still very easy to install and takes only a few minutes to get running.

It has all the major [features](http://openatrium.com/features) that you would expect, plus a few extras such as a twitter-like shoutbox system. Here are the highlights:



	
  * Blogging

	
  * Calendar

	
  * Dashboard

	
  * Document Storage

	
  * Task Management


Being open source and self-hosted adds some nice benefits; unlimited customization, full control of your data, and my favorite: can be installed on a non-public web server. Having you project management system sit behind a VPN is a great way to avoidÂ [data leaks and embarrassments](http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/14/in-our-inbox-hundreds-of-confidential-twitter-documents/).

I'm still debating which is best, Basecamp or Open Atrium - but if you want to save some money, Open Atrium is worth looking into.
