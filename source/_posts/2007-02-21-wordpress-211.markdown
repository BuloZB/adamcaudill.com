The latest and greatest version of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) (the software that powers this site) has been [released](http://wordpress.org/development/2007/02/new-releases/). This release [looks to be](http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=2.1.1) mainly small fixes; nothing earth shattering this time around. As always, painless upgrade, and all seems to be working well.

As I didn't see a package for just the changed files, I went ahead and [zipped them up](http://adamcaudill.com/files/wp-211-changes.zip). These are just the changed files from 2.1, so this should make the upgrade process much quicker if you've already got 2.1 up and running.
