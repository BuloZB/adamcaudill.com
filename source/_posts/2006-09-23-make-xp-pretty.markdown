While going through my (long) list of RSS-feeds that I monitor, I found this gem of an article: [Vista Transformation Pack: Vista-ize your XP](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/09/23/vista-transformation-pack-vista-ize-your-xp/). The [Vista Transformation Pack](http://www.windowsxlive.net/?p=137) is a clever little application that moves your XP desktop several steps closer to the beauty that is Vista. While the 'transformation' doesn't give you all of the new UI goodies that come with Vista, it does add a fair bit of eye candy.

I'm not typically one to promote UI tweaks like this, but after playing with the settings, I've now have a great looking setup without the instability that still goes with Vista.
