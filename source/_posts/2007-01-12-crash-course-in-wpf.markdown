Looking to get a good start in the [latest Microsoft technology](http://wpf.netfx3.com/)? [Rob Eisenberg](http://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_eisenberg/default.aspx) has written what appears to be a rather interesting, and quite useful, [crash course in WPF](http://devlicio.us/blogs/rob_eisenberg/archive/category/1035.aspx). If you're looking for a quick way to get up to speed, this looks like a good place to start.
