[Ralph Langner](http://www.langner.com/en/) recently spoke at TED about his team's findings on [Stuxnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet); it's a clear (and somewhat scary) insight into the wars of the future. Instead of sending fighters and bombers to take out [Iran's nuclear program](http://articles.cnn.com/2010-09-29/world/iran.cyberattack_1_nuclear-program-bushehr-nuclear-plant-malware?_s=PM:WORLD), as was done in 1981 to eliminate [Iraq's program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Opera), a carefully crafted virus slowly and methodologically damaged or destroyed vital equipment.

How long until this is used as a standard part of 'softening' a target by taking out key infrastructure (flight systems, power plants, telephone & internet, etc.) before the bombs start to fly?

For those of us that have a professional interest in security, understanding the threats both present and future is simply a necessity.

This is a must watch.

Update: If you want to dig into some technical detail, [Mark Russinovich](http://blogs.technet.com/b/markrussinovich/archive/2011/03/30/3416253.aspx) has a good write-up on it.
