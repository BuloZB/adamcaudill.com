Those of you that are into computer gadgets have surely heard of the now quite famous [Optimus keyboard](http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/) - the (once) OLED powered keyboard that has caused quite a stir. Recent, word came from the team that [Optimus will not be using OLEDs](http://community.livejournal.com/optimus_project/1775.html), the belief since then is that it will use LCD instead. Well, after many, many months of waiting to see proof that Optimus will live, [finally, we see a key](http://community.livejournal.com/optimus_project/6313.html).

This is the first real sign of life, and I believe a good indicator that we will indeed see it released. Personally, I can't wait. I'm hoping that we'll see more soon.
