I've stumbled upon a great new XP Theme (actually from Windows Media Centre 2005), seems this has been around for a while as a modified version of the WMC theme, though it's now been officially released by Microsoft for XP.

It's certainly worth the [download](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=15373C73-D5F6-4AF0-B583-D633CB021612&displaylang=en).
