A bit over a month ago, I came down with a nasty cold and things have been slipping since then. It's taken me quite some to recover. This site, a number of personal projects and just about everything else has been neglected. Today is the first day in weeks I've been up to doing anything after work. I've finally started catching up on all I've missed.

Hopefully there will be more signs of life here in the coming days, as I dig out of the pile of thousands of unread items in my RSS reader. Once I dig through that pile, there are a couple articles I've planned that I believe will be of interest.
