So far I love my Dell Mini 9;Â it's a great laptop. Though from the day I received it there's been a problem. The space bar.

It's a simple but vital key, and very frustrating when it ignores you. There seems to be a common issue on the early Mini's with the space bar sometimes ignoring input. Depending on just where you hit the key, it likely won't register.

Today I was finally fed up and contacted Dell support. After chatting with a technician for about five minutes he agreed to send me a replacement keyboard. Simple, painless, fast.

If you've got a Dell Mini, I'd advise getting the new keyboard - not only is the space bar issue corrected; but I'm hearing that a couple keys have been moved to more useful positions.

**Update:** See my comment below for the latest updates.
