My blog has been rather quiet recently, largely due to a project I've been working on for one of the largest banks in the country. The project, a dynamic, script-able, plug-in driven data capture system, has finally been released and is in production. I'll not bore you with any of the details, so I'll get right to the point:

**I've got a life again!**

Well, at least as much of a life as a developer / technologist / workaholic ever has. ;) I should be back to posting on a more regular schedule now, sorry for the extended silence.
