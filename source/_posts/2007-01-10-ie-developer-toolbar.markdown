For those that do any web development, you'll be interested to know that the [IE Team](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/) has released beta 3 of the [IE Developer Toolbar](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/01/09/ie-developer-toolbar-beta-3-now-available.aspx). From what I've seen, this looks like an impressive release. This is well worth the [download](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&displaylang=en) and has saved me a fair bit of time in the past.
