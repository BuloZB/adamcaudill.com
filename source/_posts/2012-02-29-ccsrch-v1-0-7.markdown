I've released a new version of [CCSRCH](https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch), the open-source PAN (a.k.a credit card number) search tool to help companies maintain PCI compliance. This is a fairly minor release, primarily focusing on reducing false positives. The scanner has been updated to exclude the following:



	
  * Results made up of the same two digits repeating (i.e. 5454545454545454).

	
  * Results that have seven or more of the same digits repeating (i.e. 5555555555554444).


I also fixed a bug that I introduced in v1.0.6 that prevented it from compiling on certain *nix systems; while I was in there I also fixed several instances of this building warning on newer Linux distros:


    
    warning: call to __builtin___strncat_chk might overflow destination buffer
     [enabled by default]



I also took the time to write-up really simple build instructions for *nix users:

    
    $ wget -O ccsrch.tar.gz https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch/tarball/master
    $ tar -xvzf ccsrch.tar.gz
    $ cd adamcaudill-ccsrch-<rev>/
    $ make all



This will probably be the last release for now unless a bug turns up; to improve results further I'm working on a new project ([ccsrch-score](https://github.com/adamcaudill/ccsrch-score)), hopefully it'll be released soon.
