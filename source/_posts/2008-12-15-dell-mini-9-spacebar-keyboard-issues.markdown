I recently [wrote](http://adamcaudill.com/2008/12/07/dell-mini-keyboard-issues/) about some issues I've had with my Dell Mini 9. Since I received my Mini its had issues with the keyboard, primarily that the spacebar wouldn't respond. Something I've heard several other people say; leading me to believe it's a flaw in the design.

A quick chat with Dell support and a new keyboard was on the way. Shipped FedEx Priority Overnight no less.

I ordered my Mini within hours of it being released, so it's a fairly early unit. When I received the new keyboard I was rather disappointed to see the it was marked "A00" - which is Dell-speak for version 1.0. So obviously when I saw that, it was a bit frustrating. What's the point in replacing a flawed keyboard with another flawed keyboard?

After removing the existing keyboard I found something I really didn't expect; the existing keyboard was marked "A02." So my early model Mini has the newer keyboard! So, let's take a quick look at what we know so far:



	
  * A00 - This keyboard has the same layout as the A02; the keys are printed a bit darker making it harder to see in low light. The keys are a bit stiffer when you press them, and all the keys seem to respond reliably.

	
  * A01 - I've yet to see any information on this one, though we must assume it exists.

	
  * A02 - This version has brighter printing on the keys though seems to have a defect affecting at least the spacebar and perhaps other keys. Pressing the keys, they feel somewhat cheep or flimsy.


These details are for the US-English, 61 key layout,  Dell part # M958H. There is also an US-International version (U061H) [floating](http://mydellmini.com/forum/replacement-keyboard-more-normal-t1402.html) around with a somewhat different layout that some people may prefer.

Though I don't like how dark the Aoo keyboard is, it does seem to correct the issue with the keyboard missing presses. The process of changing the keyboard only takes a few minutes and the [instructions](http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/ins910/en/sm/keyboard.htm#wp1183262) cover everything you need to know.
