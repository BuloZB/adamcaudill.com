For those that missed it (like me), the [Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511258.aspx) has been updated with some additional content. This update add content in the following areas:



	
  * [Software Branding](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511284.aspx)

	
  * [Confirmations](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511273.aspx)

	
  * [Warnings](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511263.aspx)

	
  * [Toolbars](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511500.aspx)

	
  * [Sound](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511278.aspx)

	
  * [Icons](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511280.aspx)


These guidelines are crucial to ensure the most consistent user experience possible. Though many don't, this is a document that all developers should read. I firmly believe that consistency is the most important single factor in design, and following an established style such as this is a great way to ensure that a UI is as consistent as possible.

If you'd like some background reading, the [XP version](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/System/platform/pcdesign/XPguidelines.mspx) is still available.
