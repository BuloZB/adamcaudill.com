Could it really be? [Rumors](http://www.newspress.com/Top/Article/article.jsp?Section=BUSINESS&ID=564747487697831688) are [flying](http://oraclewatch.eweek.com/blogs/google_watch/archive/2006/06/06/10601.aspx) that tomorrow (Tuesday) Google will open a beta for a new spreadsheet tool. This is quite a move, and one that will certainly turn up the heat on the Microsoft - Google rivalry.

Google Spreadsheet will have support forÂ the Excel file format, a move that seems to be setting a direct course for competing with the ever popular Microsoft Office suite. When combined with the launch of [Calendar](http://calendar.google.com/) and the acquisition of [Writely](http://www.writely.com/), Google seems to have an eye of the market now controlled by Office.

Reports are that at 9AM, EDT [Google Labs](http://labs.google.com/) will be linking to the new application and allowing a limited number of sign-ups.
