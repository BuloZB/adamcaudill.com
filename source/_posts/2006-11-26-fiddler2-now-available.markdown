A new version of the popular debugging proxy [Fiddler](http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/) has been [announced](http://insidehttp.blogspot.com/2006/11/fiddler2-experimental-edition.html). The new version, dubbed [Fiddler2](http://www.fiddlertool.com/Fiddler2/), adds support debugging HTTP**S** traffic just as you would unsecured HTTP traffic. Per the [FAQ](http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler2/faq.asp)s, this new version effectively runs a [MITM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_middle_attack) attack to do its job, while this is the most effective way of doing this, there is the downside of the browser showing an error, though you should be able to continue by ignoring these warnings.

If you develop or maintain secure web sites, this enhanced version of Fiddler will be a great help. Though this is still an alpha version, it's based on a fairly stable code base and seems to work well. This is one to keep an eye on.
