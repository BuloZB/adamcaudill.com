Time once again, for a [WordPress update](http://wordpress.org/development/2007/01/wordpress-206/), the software that powers this site. This is primary a security update, fixing a few nasty issues as well as cleaning up some other things ([here's](http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=2.0.6) the breakdown). If you are running a WordPress blog, I'd recommend going for the update.

It's a painless update, and so far seems quite stable.
