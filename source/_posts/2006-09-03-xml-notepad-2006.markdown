[![XMLNotepad 2006](http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/09/sc22708156232b.png)](http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/09/sc22708156232.png) Microsoft's Chris Lovett (of System.Xml fame) has released [XML Notepad 2006](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=72d6aa49-787d-4118-ba5f-4f30fe913628&DisplayLang=en) - a simple, easy to use, and free, XML editor. For those that regularly work with XML, an editor of this type can be an invaluable addition to your toolbox.

XML Notepad offers a basic set of features, great for those quick jobs where using an IDE or a more full-featured application would be overkill. While XML Notepad doesn't offer a great range of features, it does offer some of the most important features needed to get the job done.

As a real bonus, XML Notepad was released complete with its design documentation and source code. Always nice to take a peak under the hood of the projects Microsoft releases.

The only major gripe I have with this tool is the lack of a syntax-highlighted viewer for the XML source. In fact, it uses its non-XML cousin, Notepad to view the underlying XML. Thankfully, as this project was released with source, it should be easy to add a few new features such as this.

For those interested, here's the feature overview:



	
  * Tree View synchronized with Node Text View for quick editing of node names and values.

	
  * Incremental search (Ctrl+I) in both tree and text views, so as you type it navigates to matching nodes.

	
  * Cut/copy/paste with full namespace support.

	
  * Drag/drop support for easy manipulation of the tree, even across different instances of XML Notepad and from the file system.

	
  * Infinite undo/redo for all edit operations.

	
  * In place popup multi-line editing of large text node values.

	
  * Configurable fonts and colors via the options dialog.

	
  * Full find/replace dialog with support for regex and XPath.

	
  * Good performance on large XML documents, loading a 3mb document in about one second.

	
  * Instant XML schema validation while you edit with errors and warnings shown in the task list window.

	
  * Intellisense based on expected elements and attributes and enumerated simple type values.

	
  * Support for custom editors for date, dateTime and time datatypes and other types like color.

	
  * Handy nudge tool bar buttons for quick movement of nodes up and down the tree.

	
  * Inplace HTML viewer for processing xml-stylesheet processing instructions.

	
  * Built-in XML Diff tool.
