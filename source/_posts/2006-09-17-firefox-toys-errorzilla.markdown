While my favorite browser will always be [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), I'm a big fan of [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/); its amazing selection of add-ons (a feature that Opera sadly lacks) adds much to its value for me. With the addition of plug-ins like the excellent [Web Developer](http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/) add-on, Firefox becomes a powerful development and browsing platform.

[![ErrorZilla](http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/09/sc37757375032.thumbnail.png)](http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/09/sc37757375032.png) I just learned of a new add-on released by Eric of [roachfiend.com](http://roachfiend.com/) called [ErrorZilla](http://roachfiend.com/archives/2006/08/28/errorzilla-useful-error-pages-for-firefox/), this is a great idea. It's a replacement for the default Firefox error pages, new error pages with additional features. Here's the quick run-down of the new options presented:



	
  * Try again (refresh)

	
  * Google Cache

	
  * Wayback

	
  * Ping

	
  * Trace

	
  * Whois


Now, when faced with a dreaded "Server not found" error, it's much easier to find _some_ useful information. When researching a topic, there's nothing worse than having to go in circles trying to find a page that will load, this add-on is certainly a step in the right direction. I really hope that the Firefox developers see this add-on and consider adding this or similar functionality to the distribution.
