Microsoft is currently running a promotion for [free copies of Vista Business Edition and Office 2007 Professional](http://www.powertogether.com/). The deal looks a bit like this: You watch 3 videos, answer some questions about the videos, then fill out a form with a bunch of personal information. Sounds to me like a great deal. This is quite similar to a promotion some time back for a [free copy of Visual Studio](http://adamcaudill.com/2006/03/17/microsoft-visual-studio-2005-free/).

Here's the downside: If you are a member of the Microsoft Partner Program, or Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN), you aren't eligible for these offers.

The site is currently loading very slowly, as it seems word of this offer is spreading fast. Once I get more information on this, I'll pass it along.

_Update:_ I forgot to mention, this offer is only open to US residents.
