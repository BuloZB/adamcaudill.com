I just ran across an [announcement](http://www.mstechtoday.com/2006/10/29/microsoft-announces-new-accounting-software-and-service/) for a new Microsoft product, [Office Accounting 2007 Express](http://www.ideawins.com/index.html). This is a _free_, and surprisingly full featured accounting package aimed at small businesses. If you run a business, or plan on starting one, this looks like a great addition to your tech-toolkit. I'll post more on this again once I have time to review it more thoroughly.
