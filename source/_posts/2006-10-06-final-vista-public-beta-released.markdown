The final public beta build (5744) of the next generation of Windows has been [released](http://blogs.technet.com/windowsvista/archive/2006/10/06/Windows-Vista-RC2-is-now-available-to-technical-beta-testers_2100_.aspx) (via [shell: revealed](http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/externalnews/archive/2006/10/06/Windows-Vista-RC2-Build-5744-Released.aspx)). With this announcement it looks like Vista will indeed be on time. For awhile I was wondering if Vista had any chance of making it, but it seems that it will indeed. While this is certainly good news, the RTM build is the one that has my interest.

Playing with a release candidate can be fun, there's no doubt about it; but the real fun starts when you can see how things work and behave on the final - (hopefully) working build. I've got a ton of software to test, and a number of applications to update to take advantage of the latest goodies Vista offers - that's the fun part.
