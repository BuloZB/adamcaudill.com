> ![Notepad Feature](http://adamcaudill.com/files/2006/07/NotepadFeature2.png)


Here's a great little feature I just [heard about](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/07/07/weird-hidden-notepad-feature-create-a-log-file/) to make the always useful though mostly featureless Notepad utility even more useful. If you create a new file and put "`.LOG`" (case-sensitive) as the first thing in the file, each time you open the file after that it will append a timestamp to the end of the file. While you could just press the "`F5`" button to insert the timestamp, this does have the advantage of added simplicity.

Microsoft has a [knowledge base article](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=260563) on this feature, it indicates that the feature is supported on Windows 98 & Me, but my tests indicate it is also present in 2000 & XP.

This is a great feature if you need to keep manual logs, I think this just might come in handy.
