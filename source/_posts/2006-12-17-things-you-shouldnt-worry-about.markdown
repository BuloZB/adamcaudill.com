I've been a fan of [Patrick's blog](http://microisvjournal.wordpress.com/) for some time now, and one of his recent articles, [_Things You Shouldn’t Worry About_](http://microisvjournal.wordpress.com/2006/12/05/things-you-shouldnt-worry-about/), really shines. While I can't agree with everything, most of the points really make sense. If you run an ISV, or are thinking about starting one, I highly recommend that you read this, it's well worth it.
