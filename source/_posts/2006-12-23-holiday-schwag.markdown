The [Valleyschwag](http://store.valleyschwag.com/) crew has released their 5th package, a [holiday package](http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/12/13/all-hail-the-holiday-schwag/) no less. I ordered mine a few days ago, and it arrived today. While I believe the guys behind Valleyschwag made a [real mistake](http://adamcaudill.com/2006/10/05/not-not-a-good-idea/), it's nice to see that they are still hard at it.

This is a nice package, with goodies from [Guba](http://www.guba.com/), [mingle](http://minglenow.com/) and [WebShots](http://www.webshots.com/) (along with a few others). All in all, a rather nice package.
