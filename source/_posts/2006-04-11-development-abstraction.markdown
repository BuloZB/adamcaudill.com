When it comes to the world of development, [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)  is, without a doubt, my favorite writer. His work is always interesting and on-topic, and his latest work is something special. [Development Abstraction](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/DevelopmentAbstraction.html), what a concept, the only way to ensure the highest productivity, and perhaps, a large part of the [Superstars & Monkeys](http://adamcaudill.com/2006/04/07/superstars-monkeys/)  issue.

When I wrote about my views on how developers are treated, it was from a developers perspective, this article provides the managers perspective, on much the same issue. This covers what a development team should see, noting more, nothing less. Focus is critical for productivity, the hassles of running a business, finding ways around over-restrictive internet filters, or wondering how long the Development database will be hosting Production databases, none of this should be involved in a developers day.

Development is a thought driven, focus dependent activity. Anything that gets in the way should be eliminated, anything.
