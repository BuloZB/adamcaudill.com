While this is probably more about marketing than anything, Anti-Virus vendor [Computer Associates](http://www.ca.com/) is offering a [free one year subscription](http://www.my-etrust.com/Microsoft/vista/default.aspx)Â  ([press release](http://www3.ca.com/press/PressRelease.aspx?CID=88876&culture=en-us)) of it's [EZ Antivirus](http://store.digitalriver.com/servlet/ControllerServlet?Action=DisplayPage&Locale=en_US&id=ProductDetailsPage&SiteID=caconsum&productID=35180700) product to beta testers of Windows Vista.

This is the type of responsibility that more vendors should accept, there are thousands of Vista boxes now running, and one can only guess how many have no form of virus protection in place. CA is not only making a great business decision, they are also helping to serve the community by reducing the number of unprotected systems connected to the internet.

It's good to see a company like CA make this kind of move, anytime a company as large as CA is able to see beyond the bottom line, everybody stands to win.
