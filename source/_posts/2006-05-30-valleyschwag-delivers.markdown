[Valleyschwag](http://valleyschwag.com/) has delivered! There for a couple days I was worried as the middle of the month went by without a word, but on Friday, [word went out](http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/05/26/the-may-issue/) that the [schwag shipped](http://adamcaudill.com/2006/05/26/the-schwag-has-shipped/). And today, just four days later, it has arrived.

I'll admit, I was a bit unsure about this idea at first, but now that I've got my hands on this pile o' goodies, I'm hooked. Not only is Valleyschwag a great marketing idea, but so far has proved to be a great service. Here's a breakdown of the goodies:



	
  * A _very_ cool [MovableType](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/) hat & key-chain/necklace thing.

	
  * the signature [Ruby Red](http://rubyredlabs.com/) t-shirt.

	
  * A [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com/) t-shirt. (Seems [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) really likes this schwag thing.)

	
  * A pack of puzzle cards from [PerplexCity](http://www.perplexcity.com/).

	
  * A pencil from [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/).

	
  * Stickers from: [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com/), [EFF](http://www.eff.org/), and [Goatse](http://www.goatsesticker.com/home.html).

	
  * A temporary tattoo from [abazab](http://www.abazab.com/).


For $14.99, this is a great deal, the hat alone made it worth it (the hat is definitely my favorite piece). Yeah, it's official, I'm a fan.
