I'm a fairly active member of a forum focus on VB development, [XtremeVBTalk.com](http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/) (formerly VisualBasicForum.com), I also happen to be a moderator, and carry the "Expert" skill-badge. Well, today they gave me quite a surprise. Back 2003 I posted this on my site at the time:


> _** 12/01/2003**
**Expert!** The folks over at [VisualBasicForum.com](http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/) just voted to give me an Expert badge!_


Today, a similar honor has been bestowed. By a vote of the forum leadership I've been given the status of "Guru" - the highest skill acknowledgment available. This was quite a surprise, and really quite an honor as this is a status given to only a select few. This makes me the 26th to receive this, of the 91,348 current members.

I really do appreciate this, to be judged so by a group that I hold in such high regard really does mean a lot.
