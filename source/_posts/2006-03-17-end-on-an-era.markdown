Magazines are great, I really like just being able to pick one up, lay back and do some reading. Development magazines, not so great. They tend to have a higher price, far less content, and more ad pages than content pages. Eric Sink think [they are dying](http://software.ericsink.com/entries/Magazines_Dying.html), and based on [the announcement](http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=8903/ddj1142366567743/ddj060314news.html) that "Software Development" is being dissolved, looks like he's right.

It's too bad really, I almost hate to see them go, but I have to ask, do they really have any relevance in the modern development world?
