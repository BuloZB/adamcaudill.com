I've been using the '[Web Developer Toolbar & Menu for Opera](http://operawiki.info/WebDevToolbar)' for about the last month and after being reminded today about how useful it is, I thought I should probably mention it for those that haven't heard about it.

This is an extremely useful set of toolbar modification to Opera to have a few very nice touches to it. For most of these tasks, there is a Firefox extension available, [Web Developer](http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/), which does the job quite nicely. Though switching back & forth just to check something small can be quite a pain (as Opera is my primary browser), so thanks to this little gem, it save me that much more time.

As they say, time is money, so every bit saved is a good thing.
