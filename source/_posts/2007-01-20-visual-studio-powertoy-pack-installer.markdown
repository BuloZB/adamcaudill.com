An update to the [Visual Studio PowerToy Pack Installer](http://www.codeplex.com/PackInstaller) has just been [announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/jeremykelley/archive/2007/01/18/pack-installer-beta-2-released-and-feed-update-for-1-18-2007.aspx). This handy application wraps up many of the [PowerToys](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718340.aspx) so that they can be installed from one easy to use UI. With so many of these Power Toys available, this installer is great to have; otherwise finding and installing them can be a slow and painful experience.

If you're a power user, or fancy yourself a power tweaker, this one might just be for you.
