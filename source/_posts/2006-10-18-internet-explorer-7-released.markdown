For those of you that are interested, [IE7 has been released](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/10/18/internet-explorer-7-for-windows-xp-available-now.aspx). After following the progress of the next generation of IE since March of last year, I've got to say, I'm really excited to see it go public. The only real surprise for me with this announcement is that many expected the Mozilla Foundation to release Firefox 2.0 prior to Internet Explorer's big release, yet no word from them. I'm wondering if there were more issues in the [RC2 release](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/10/09/firefox-2-rc2/) that delayed the launch.

It's good to know that the security and compatibility issue of the older versions of IE can now fade away into the past (where they belong).
