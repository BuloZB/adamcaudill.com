The legendary [Robert Scoble](http://scobleizer.com/) has just posted word the [Vista _may_ now be gold](http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/04/windows-vista-is-done/). It'll be interesting to see when we get official word. I don't know about anyone else, but I can't wait till Vista hits the MSDN Subscriber downloads so I can start playing with the final.
