I just dropped by to check my Gmail account (which is almost never used, and the address has never been published anywhere), and found quite a surprise. The spam box currently has **7,026** spam messages!

Keeping in mind that spam is deleted after 30 days, that means I'm getting _7,000 spam messages a month_ to an unknown, unpublished account! All of my other email accounts use two layers of filtering, one at the server, the other in the client. With this much spam going to an almost secret account, I can only image the spam going to my published accounts.

I actively use six separate email accounts, if each gets 7,000 spam messages a month, I'd be spending my entire week without sleeping just going through spam. Spam just seems that much more evil every day.
