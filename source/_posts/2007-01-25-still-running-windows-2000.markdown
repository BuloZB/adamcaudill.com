For those that may be running Windows 2000, there's some things you need to know.

With the [change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005) in [DST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) taking effect March 2nd, your Windows 2000 boxes may see some odd behavior. There [won't](http://ushipoisv.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!29862A22A3FBB38D!156.entry) be Windows Update patch or hot-fix released for this (unless you have an extended support agreement); so there's some work ahead to keep things running smoothly.

Microsoft has [released](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/914387) ([read more](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/timezone/dst2007.mspx)) a fair bit of information (complete with sample scripts) that can be used to update any 2000 boxes you may have lying around. Those of us that keep 2000 boxes around for testing or even production use will need to make sure they are updated. I can only imagine the odd errors this will cause if these changes aren't put in place.

This is a bit of an annoyance, I really wish Microsoft would have released this in the form of a Windows Update, though I guess this will probably help drive home the reality that it's time to upgrade for many users.
