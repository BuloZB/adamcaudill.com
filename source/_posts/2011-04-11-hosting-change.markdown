I'm in the process of migrating my sites from Â a [Dreamhost VPS](http://www.dreamhost.com/hosting-vps.html), to fully managed hosting by [Gray Hills Software](http://www.grayhills.com/). In my tests so far, the loading time has been cut in half with this switch. Pages load faster, the server is better configured (new software, and more options), and seeing as they have both Windows and Linux servers, I can use one provider with whatever technology suits me and my projects.

There may be a few bumps as I move things, but all should stable soon.
