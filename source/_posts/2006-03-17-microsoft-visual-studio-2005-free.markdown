I like free stuff, I really like free stuff from Microsoft, as they normally have good free stuff, and this time, it's a free copy of Visual Studio 2005 Standard Edition, and a couple other goodies. Here's the list:



	
  * Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2005 Standard Edition (Not for Resale)

	
  * Five chapters of Programming ASP.NET 2.0 Core Reference, by Dino Esposito

	
  * A 30-day hosting account to try out your custom Web applications

	
  * Microsoft Developer Security DVD with how-tos, white papers, tools, webcasts, and code samples that demonstrate how to write more secure code

	
  * A 50% discount on a Microsoft Certified Professional Exam so you can add your new skills to your resume

	
  * A voucher that allows you to buy Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition with an MSDN® Professional Subscription at renewal pricing (a $400 savings)


Not a bad grab bag if I say so myself. Want the details?

	
  * You have to be in the US or Canada

	
  * You have till April 17th

	
  * You have to watch 3 ASP.NET related webcasts


Sounds like a deal to me, I'm in. [Here's the link](http://www.learn2asp.net/campaign.aspx).
