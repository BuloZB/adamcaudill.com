[Valleyschwag](http://valleyschwag.com/) has [shipped](http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/05/26/the-may-issue/) the second issue of their bundle o' schwag to approximately 1,500 subscribers, up from 50 for the first issue. The growth is amazing, and so is the money involved. This month they should have seen somewhere around $21,500 in gross revenue.

For a part-time project where you are just mailing out free stuff, $22,000 a month is not bad at all. There are of course a number of expenses, but this is what's important: this is an innovative business model that really works. How well it would go in other industries, I don't know, but after seeing the popularity of the Kings o' Schwag, I'm sure we'll see similar attempts in other industries.
