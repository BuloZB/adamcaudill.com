If you are looking to get started working with [WPF](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663326.aspx), then [Tim Sneath](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/default.aspx) has a great guide for where to start: [_Building a Perfect WPF Developer Workstation_](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2006/12/20/building-a-perfect-wpf-developer-workstation.aspx).

This guide includes links to all the software you need, sample projects, and even where to go with questions. If you're new to WPF, or want to take your WPF skills to the next level, this is a great place to start.
