Over the next few weeks (and months) I'll be posting a series of articles on the tools and services that start-ups can use to make their business both more efficient and more profitable. This is aimed at ISVs (both micro and close to micro) though most of this should apply to any technology startup.

When you are starting a business, there are many important considerations with anything you use, here are the keys points I'll be looking at:



	
  * Expense - This is probably the top requirement. Budgets tend to be quite limited, and there are always too many demands on what budget is available.

	
  * Effectiveness - It has to work; when running an ISV you simply don't have time to waste. There is software to build and a business to run - there's no time to waste on things that don't work.

	
  * Power - Just because you're running a small business, doesn't mean you have to miss out on the power and features available to significantlyÂ larger business.

	
  * Flexibility - ISVs have a great benefit over larger businesses; agility. The very nature of smaller businesses give them a great ability to adapt to change - and the tools and services they use should be just as flexible.


There are many great resources out there - the challenge is digging through the clutter.
