It looks like the core Silverlight 3 tools are now available:



	
  * [Microsoft Expression Blend 3 + SketchFlow RC](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=92e1db7a-5d36-449b-8c6b-d25f078f3609)

  * [Microsoft® Silverlight™ 3 Tools for Visual Studio 2008 SP1](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=9442b0f2-7465-417a-88f3-5e7b5409e9dd)

Though the tools needed for development seem to be public, I've yet to see the end-user run-time; though I imagine we'll see that in the release anticipated for tomorrow.

Time to have some fun. :)

_Update_: Client run-time is now [available](http://www.microsoft.com/silverlight/resources/install.aspx).
