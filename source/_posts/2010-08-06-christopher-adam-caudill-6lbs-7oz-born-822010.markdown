On Monday, August 2nd 2010 at 11:16 PM, Christopher Adam Caudill was born.

Weighing in at 6 pounds and 7 ounces and 19.25 inches, born just 24 minutes after our arrival at the hospital. He was born almost a month early, and was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, in addition to having issues maintaining his body temperature (as is common with babies born early). Thankfully, the next day the pneumonia diagnosis was withdrawn and his body temperature stabilized.

On Wednesday afternoon, both mother and baby were discharged with a clean bill of health.

(Sorry for not posting this sooner, decided it would be best to drop off the radar until things calmed down.)
