About six months ago, I [predicted the end](http://adamcaudill.com/2006/10/05/not-not-a-good-idea/) of the [Valleyschwag](http://valleyschwag.com/) project, that prediction recently came to pass. The Valleyscwag team recently  [announced](http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2007/04/05/happy-trails/) the last 'issue' and the end of the schwag express. I knew it was coming, looks like I called it a bit too soon.

The model they had was interesting idea, just not one that could scale. Perhaps with a more restrictive subscription system, maybe if they had based it on invitations instead of being completely open, they could have slowed the growth enough. Perhaps, it was an idea that just would have never worked.

Either way, what's over is over. The final issue has already sold out, so the party is officially over.
