Later this week I'll start the process of closing my start-up, aDeVIX Software. After months of planning and development, the decision has finally been made to call it a day. It was a great idea, but time and money conspired against us, with great effect.

We had a great product in mind, just not the resources to make it happen. I do believe that it would have been quite a success, but it takes a fair bit of time, and even more money to launch a commercial product aimed at mid-size businesses. It's not a simple thing to sell software costing more than $10,000 per install; and being a company with no reputation, it's almost impossible.

We planned the design, the marketing, the budget (even allowing for snacks & drinks), covered every detail, but when you don't have the time to write code, or the money to pay people to write it for you; no amount of planning will help. We then delayed, then came up with smaller, simpler products, then scrapped all that and went back to the original idea.

Months of work, thousands of dollars in various expenses, and not a single dime as income; much effort, no reward. Many thousand lines of code, a few websites, countless meetings, and enough notes to account for the clearing of a small forest; but no money, no assets of value, nothing. It's a bit painful to think about all the effort, and see that it was all for not.

It's certainly possible to make an ISV work, it's just a matter of being honest with yourself. Can you afford the expenses? Do you have the time? Will you be able to support the product yourself until it brings in enough money to hire people?

In some ways though, I'm happy that this is done, as it now leaves me free of any potential conflict of interest when it comes to pursuing future opportunities.
