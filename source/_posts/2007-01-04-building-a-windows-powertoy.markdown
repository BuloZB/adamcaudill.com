[Brandon Paddock](http://brandonlive.com/) is writing what promises to to an interesting series on creating a Windows PowerToy on the [Windows Shell Team blog](http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2007/01/04/Building-a-Windows-PowerToy-_2D00_-Part-1.aspx). This series promises to provide an interesting insight into the process of developing my favorite part of Windows: PowerToys. I've always looked forward to seeing the next generation of Power Toys after a new version of Windows is released; seeing the process of one being developed will be a real treat.

This looks like one worth watching.
