Microsoft has [announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/05/26/608255.aspx) the naming of the Windows Vista edition of IE. Internet Explorer 7+ will be the name used to refer to the Vista edition, while 7 (minus the plus) will be used to reference the non-Vista edition. While the name has been changed for Vista, this seems to mostly be about marketing (or communication) as the User-Agent for both edition will contain "`MSIE 7.0`;" - no plus.

Also detailed, are the features that won't make it to the XP edition of 7, they are as follows:



	
  * [Protected Mode](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/20/471975.aspx)

	
  * [Parental Controls](http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/03/01/541701.aspx)

	
  * Improved Network Diagnostics
