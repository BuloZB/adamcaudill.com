I must have missed the memo on this, but it seems the first service pack for Visual Studio 2005  has been [released](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=bb4a75ab-e2d4-4c96-b39d-37baf6b5b1dc&DisplayLang=en) ([release notes](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=928957)). This release should add a lot of stability to the IDE and resolve of number of issues (such as the frequent VB compiler crashes). It's a rather large download, approximately 450 MB, and is rather slow to install, but it promises to be well worth it.

The one real downside, is that you shouldn't plan on doing much while it's installing; the almost 400 MB of RAM consumed during parts of the installation may slow your system to a crawl. So, make plans to do something else while it's working, because you wont be.
