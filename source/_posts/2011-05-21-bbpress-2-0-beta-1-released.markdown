This morning, the latest version of my favorite forum software, bbPress, was [released](http://bbpress.org/blog/2011/05/bbpress-2-0-beta-1/). While this is a beta and not a final release, it's still a major event for the project: this release is in the form of a WordPress plugin, instead of a stand-alone application as it's been in the past. In December 2009 [I wrote about this decision](http://adamcaudill.com/2009/12/16/bbpress-is-the-end-near/) - and at the time I was rather disappointed with the change in direction; but now my views have changed. I'm also excited to see that [Matt](http://ma.tt/) and his company, [Automattic](http://automattic.com/) have decided to invest the time and money needed to make this happen; there for a while it looked like bbPress really was dying.

Thanks to services like [StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/) and its numerous clones, it seems the days of standalone forums are numbered; when combined with the increasing strength of WordPress as a full-blown CMS, this move actually makes a lot of sense.

I'm excited both as a user and developer - this opens many new doors from both perspectives, and will certainly increase adoption of the software, as integration with the current version is [a bit tricky](http://adamcaudill.com/2011/03/06/bbpress-wordpress-3-1-registration-issues/).

Congratulations to the entire team on this release; it really is a major milestone for the project!
