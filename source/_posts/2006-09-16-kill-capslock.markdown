Most people I know have issues with the CapsLock key; with feelings ranging from annoyance to sheer hatred. More often than not, I fall into the sheer hatred side of things. I've played with various ideas to solve the problem. Everything from a system tray notification when CapsLock is on, to physically removing the evil key itself. After all these attempts, I have found I like none of them.

Enter [waNOCAPS](http://winadmin.forret.com/registry/wanocaps/) (from the [Winadmin tools](http://winadmin.forret.com/) project), a registry modification to quickly and cleanly remap the CapsLockÂ to a third Ctrl key. This is nice in that it's a simple registry change, not something as ugly as a background program to alter the CapsLock state or value as many CapsLock killers use.

This seems to be a clean, simple solution to an annoying "feature" - one I'll certainly be using.
