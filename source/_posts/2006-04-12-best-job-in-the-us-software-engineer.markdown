MONEY Magazine and Salary.com have announced their [top 10 jobs](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/)  in the country. While it's no surprise to me, Software Engineer took the #1 spot. Here's what they had to say:

> _**Why it's great** Software engineers are needed in virtually every part of the economy, making this one of the fastest-growing job titles in the U.S. Even so, it's not for everybody.  
  
Designing, developing and testing computer programs requires some pretty advanced math skills and creative problem-solving ability. If you've got them, though, you can work and live where you want: Telecommuting is quickly becoming widespread.  
  
The profession skews young -- the up-all-night-coding thing gets tired -- but consulting and management positions aren't hard to come by once you're experienced.  
  
**What's cool** Cutting-edge projects, like designing a new video game or tweaking that military laser. Extra cash from freelance gigs. Plus, nothing says cool like great prospects.  
  
**What's not** Jobs at the biggest companies tend to be less creative (think Neo, pre-Matrix). Outsourcing is a worry. Eyestrain and back, hand and wrist problems are common._

Software development is certainly a great career, and here is yet more proof - from outside the industry.
