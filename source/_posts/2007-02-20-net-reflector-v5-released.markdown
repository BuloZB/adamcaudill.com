The great [Lutz Roeder](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/) has released a new version of the [.NET Reflector](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/). From what I've seen; this version is extremely nice. This has long been a required tool of any serious developer. With this update Reflector has reinforced its position in the list of tools you just can't live without.

Scott Hanselman provides a [great review](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Reflector5ReleasedWorldDominationAssured.aspx); check it out for the details on what's new.
