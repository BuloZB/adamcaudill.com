The WWW is dying - no, not the web itself, but the ubiquitous WWW prefix on many domains. While there have been [efforts](http://no-www.org/) to encourage developers to move away from the use of this prefix for some time, this movement seems to be gaining ground.

[Matt Mullenweg](http://photomatt.net/) of [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) fame has released a plug-in to [automatically remove the WWW prefix](http://photomatt.net/2006/06/13/wordpress-no-www/). While this isn’t earth shattering news, it does show a trend away from the traditional prefixes to a simpler model. A change that I certainly welcome.

From the day this site went online it’s removed the WWW if used, providing a single, [optimized](http://wisdump.com/webmastering/benefits-of-removing-www-from-your-url/) URL for all pages. Now that methods to implement such functionality are becoming so simple, I expect it will become even more common as bloggers adopt a single URL model (hopefully the non-WWW form).
