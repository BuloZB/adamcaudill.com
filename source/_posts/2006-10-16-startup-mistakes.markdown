For those looking to get into the startup/ISV scene, Paul Graham's latest work is a great read. [The 18 Mistakes that Kill Startups](http://paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html) takes an interesting look at some of the larger issues to avoid while forming a new company. Personally, I'd call this one a must read.
