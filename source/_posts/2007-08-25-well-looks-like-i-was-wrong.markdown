Well, it was a while back that I said I would start writing again - that just never quite happened.

Much interesting has happened in these months, a few co-workers left the company, a few new faces came in; there was also a promotion and a number of new projects. Oh, and there's a new relationship, and a fair bit of time now going to my old profession and now hobby of photography. Between all of these, spare time isn't something I have much of - if any.

With all this in mind, many people would give up and walk away - but I see this as being important enough to fight for. It's a matter of priorities and time management. For a developer, being active in the community is important; it's easy to be left behind once you find yourself outside the loop. So, I'll simply have to make community involvement a higher priority than it's been. As for time management though, the story isn't so simple.

I've been using [Tasks](http://crowdfavorite.com/tasks/) (which I [highly recommend](http://adamcaudill.com/2007/01/21/task-management-with-tasks/)) for a while now to keep track of what I'm working on, and for that it is quite effective. For time management though, I need to reevaluate how I work completely; find a method that allows me to be as productive as possible. I've seen a number of articles, guides, and books on the topic, so I believe I've a fair bit of reading in front of me. As I go through this process, I'll write about my findings, and share any solutions I find.

If anybody has advice on how to make time for everything, I would certainly like to hear it. Hopefully, this time when I say this blog is coming back to life, it actually will.
