After several months of tests and experiments, I have finally determined something: [Infrared](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_photography) with the Lumix [DMC-FZ8](http://www.dpreview.com/news/0701/07013106panasonicfz8.asp) just doesn't work.

I've been trying to use a [R72](http://www.jpgmag.com/stories/71) Near-Infrared filter to filter out the "normal" light that we see, leaving only the infrared light that I wanted to capture. The FZ8 is sensitive to infrared, as can be easily demonstrated by taking a picture of a TV remote control. What you'll see is a couple points of light coming from the remote; these are the infrared lights that are used to transmit commands to the TV.

Though having a camera that is sensitive to infrared, doesn't make it suited for infrared photography. While the FZ8 is a great camera, being light weight, offering pro-level options (such as RAW mode) without the bulk of a DSLR - this is one thing that just doesn't work.

Here are a few of the issues I've seen, and so far been unable to get passed:



	
  * Auto-Focus: While this isn't a huge surprise, auto-focus doesn't work when the R72 filter is in place.

	
  * Manual-Focus: The FZ8 does offer manual focus, though using it when there is so little light making it to the sensor is nearly impossible.

	
  * Grainy: Even when ISO is set to 100 instead of the default of auto, the images are extremely grainy. While this can provide a somewhat artistic effect - it's not what I'm looking for.


While it does seem to have some promise in replicating an infrared version of [pinhole photography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera), it simply doesn't work for traditional infrared.
