After 2 years, my [favorite forum software](http://bbpress.org/) has been [officially released](http://bbpress.org/blog/2006/10/bbpress-072/). I've been a big fan of bbPress since it's early days, I even had at least one patch accepted. So I guess one could say I was a developer on the project (although, a very minor one).

It's great to see this project make it. If you're looking for high-quality PHP-based forum solution without the weight of something like [vB](http://www.vbulletin.com/), then bbPress is the answer.
