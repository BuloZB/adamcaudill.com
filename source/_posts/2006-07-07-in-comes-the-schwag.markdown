The [third edition](http://valleyschwag.com/chronicles/2006/06/30/shipping-in-progress/) of [ValleySchwag](http://valleyschwag.com/) has arrived. Yet again, there is a nice collection of goodies - well worth the membership fee.

While a bit less loaded than [last time](http://adamcaudill.com/2006/05/30/valleyschwag-delivers/) , I'm still quite impressed with the package they've put together. The two big hits this time are the rather cool shirt from [imeem](http://www.imeem.com/) and the laptop bag (see below) from [MI6](http://www.mi6conference.com/index.htm). While the bag doesn't have the padding of my regular bag, it's a _lot_ lighter, so I know it'll see some use.

All in all, I'm quite happy with this months package, and I'll certainly be looking forward to the next round. For those interested, here's a list of vendor's that provided something cool for this months package:



	
  * [imeem](http://www.imeem.com/) - Mostly-cool t-shirt

	
  * [MI6](http://www.mi6conference.com/index.htm) - The laptop bag pictured above.

	
  * [jeteye](http://www.jeteye.com/) - A useful little pen (the clicky type, that are so useful for annoying those in near-by cubicles).

	
  * [Channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/) - Microsoft's Channel 9 provided a highly throw-able version of their mascot, _Channel 9 Guy_.

	
  * [Macromedia](http://www.adobe.com/) - A might-be-useful-someday key chain (bottom left corner of the picture above.

	
  * There are also about 5 other companies that provided stickers.
