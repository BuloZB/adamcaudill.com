Taking a rather extended lunch break today, I went to the [Blue Hole waterfall](http://www.cs.utk.edu/~dunigan/landforms/m.php?wpt=CTF001) near Elizabethton in east Tennessee. What a sight!

I know my policy is to avoid blogging about things not related to the IT/Software Development industry, but this sight is certainly worth breaking the policy. If you like waterfalls, or just 'getting away" this is a great place to go. If you'd like to see more, I've uploaded a [few pictures](http://flickr.com/photos/89756004@N00/sets/72157594154722533/) to my [Flickr page](http://flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/).

Speaking of Flickr, in a previous life I worked as a photographer and as such I've built up quite a collection, over the next few weeks I'll be scanning parts of my collection and uploading them. They cover a wide range of topics, so odds are you'll find something you like. Just as a note, I've added a link to my Flickr page in the "Sites" list as "My Photos" on the left panel.
