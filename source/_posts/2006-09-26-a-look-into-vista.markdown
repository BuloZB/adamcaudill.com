Ever wondered how they do things inside of Microsoft? As a developer that makes extensive uses of Microsoft technologies and tools, I'm always interested in an insight into their development process. Well, if you're like me, then I may have a real treat for you.

[Vinny Pasceri](http://www.pasceri.com/about_me/index.html), the [AERO](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/experiences/aero.mspx) Program Manager for Microsoft has posted an [great insight](http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/09/26/A-look-into-the-feature-design-process.aspx) on the ([fairly new](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/09/20/windows-ui-team-has-a-blog/)) [Windows Client Team Blog](http://shellrevealed.com/). This is a great peak into what the design process looks like, and even includes what may be the first publicly released [feature spec](http://shellrevealed.com/files/folders/specs/entry2770.aspx). This makes for a great read, I highly recommend taking a close look at this article and the included spec.
