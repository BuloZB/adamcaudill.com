I've updated evalTray again, now to include a couple new functions, as well as now using the .NET 2.0 Framework. Hopefully there will be additional updates soon, as I find features that would be useful.

Changes:

_2006.0.1.81 (Feb. 26, 2006)_



	
  * ToBase64 - Encodes a string using the Base 64 algorithm.

	
  * FromBase64 - Decodes a Base 64 string.

	
  * Fixed Copy from Result window issue.

	
  * Parameters are now automatically formatted.
