I recently took a trip down to the [local VW](http://www.wallacevolkswagen.com/en_US/) dealership to see what the ['07 Jetta](http://www.vw.com/jetta/index.html)'sÂ  look like. I was rather [impressed](http://www.vw.com/jetta/features_ext.html). The new Jetta is a very sharp, very sporty car; a rather impressive ride. I had no intention of buying, I just wanted to take one for a test drive.

That is, until I saw a black [Wolfsburg edition](http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1404569). As soon as I saw the car, I knew it was true: love at first sight is real. ;)

After 3-hours and signing a small mountain of papers, I had a new car. Not just a car, my first _**new**_ car.

**Update:** The promised picture (now that Flickr uploading works again):
