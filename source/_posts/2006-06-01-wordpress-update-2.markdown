The [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) team has [released 2.0.3](http://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/) of the massively popular blogging software. The primary reason is a security fix, but also includes a few performance tweaks. The install process was fairly painless thanks to the work of [Mark Jaquith](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/06/01/wordpress-203-upgrade-changed-files-zip-changes-diff-changed-files-list/), using the provided patch reduced the total upgrade time to under an hour.

For the average WordPress user that doesn't have any modified files, the install should take only a couple minutes. It's a very simple process, if you haven't updated, you should.Â
