At long last, Windows has a real, [power user's shell](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx); and it's been [officially done](http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2006/11/14/windows-powershell-1-0-released.aspx). PowerShell is the new, highly flexible and extremely powerful shell for Windows (XP SP2+). From my first experiences with it, I'm quite impressed. This is a great tool for developers, system administrators, and just about any other power user.

While PowerShell doesn't offer the power or flexibility that a traditional *nix shell does, the power is impressive. I've been looking forward to this being released, now that I've played with it, I've even more excited. This is a great tool, just trust me, [get it](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/download.mspx), you need it.
