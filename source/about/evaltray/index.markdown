I've written a small utility that may be of some use to VB developers (or anyone familiar with VB or VBScript). This is basically a wrapper for the Microsoft Script Control's Eval method, the idea being to test simple lines of code or quick math tasks.  This simply executes VBScript code and returns either an error message if you made a mistake or the returned value.

This makes use of both the Microsoft Script Control to allow the execution of VBScript; as well .NET's ability to compile on the fly. This allows the user to execute code using either engine, depending on the task. VBScript is faster, though a more limited language while .NET is slowly, but offers the full power of the .NET Framework.

It's just a simple tool in a developers toolkit, but something you might find useful.

IMPORTANT: evalTray currently crashes when used on Windows 7. I am in the process of re-writingÂ evalTray and will be posting an updated version soon.
