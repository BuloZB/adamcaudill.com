### Me

I'm Adam Caudill, a 31 year-old software developer & architect, security researcher, avid fan of great software, a lover of fine [Japanese Katanas](http://flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/sets/72157594276549640/), a collector of [bayonets](/bayonet-collection/) and a technical elitist. In addition to all of that, I also occupy myself with [reading](/reading/) and [photography](/photo/).

While I tend to spend most of my time in C# at work, I've recently become a big fan of Ruby. I also have a background in Visual Basic, C/C++, and PHP development, as well as a few other languages that I avoid these days. I tend to limit the number of languages I work in so that I can better focus on those I use regularly.

If you want more, take a look at my [resume](/resume/).

### Software

One day when I was 15 I happened on a copy of Visual Basic 5 Deluxe Learning Edition on sale in a book store; being bored and needing something to occupy my time during the summer, I bought it. That single chance event changed my life.

In the years since I've focused (almost obsessively) on software development, studying C++, COBOL, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, Python, and even some x86 assembler. I tend to focus on a single language and try to become an expert, rather than simply be familiar with many; at work I primarily work in C#, personal work is mainly in Ruby. My previous primary language choices have been PHP and of course VB.

I've always had a passion for the open source world and have contributed to several. A couple that are notable: I served as the Project Manager for [SWEBS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/swebs/) (a simple, lightweight HTTP server), and I've contributed to [bbPress](http://bbpress.org/) among others.

Among the applications I've released publicly, GSuite (no longer available) was the most popular at around 50,000 downloads. It was the first major system tray based alert for Gmail users that they had new mail; released long before it was eventually obsoleted by an official application from Google.

### Security

From my earliest days as a developer I was drawn into security - with friends in the field I was pulled into their projects more than once. So security has always been present in my mind. As the years have gone by (and I keep seeing more horribly insecure code) my interest in security has steadily grown into a real passion. Between pen-testing web and desktop applications at work, and my own research for fun - I've found I really love breaking software.

### Photography

Aside from software and security, my other passion is photography, you can see my more recent work on my [flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamcaudill/). My love of photography came from working as a photojournalist during my teen years for a small newspaper in East Tennessee. During the years I worked there, I came to understand the importance of visual media and the critical importance of freedoms granted to the press.

Most of my time behind a camera has been with 35mm film, though in recent years I am now exclusively digital. I used many cameras through the years, the Yashica FX-3 Super 2000 and Canon AE-1 Program being my favorite for all-manual work; the ever impressive Nikon N90s being my favorite automatic film camera. My current setup is a Nikon D80 with the extremely handy MB-D80 and a Nikon SB-600 flash.

Most of my work is outdoors with either natural light, or a single hot-shoe flash; I tend to avoid studio work.

### Work

I work in the call-center industry, my team is primarily responsible developing reporting & data capture applications. Working in an industry that has a habit of turning on a dime raises some interesting challenges; not the least of which is the short deadlines and ever-changing requirements - and doing all of that while ensuring security. It's certainly a challenge, but life would just be too boring without rewriting specifications on a daily basis. ;)
