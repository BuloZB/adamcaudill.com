This is a new hobby that I picked up recently after my father gave me a bayonet as a surprise gift. I've been rather hooked since then. Here you'll find the gallery for my small but growing collection.


### Turkish M1935


This is my first bayonet, a Turkish Model 1935, in a rather impressive condition.

### Czech VZ24


I _believe_ this is a Czech VZ24 bayonet, which would place in in the WWII time period. It's not in the greatest condition but it is a rather interesting piece because of the "kill mark" notches in the handle. Here is the history, as it was sent to me:


> _Picked this up in Slovakia while visiting a small village. It belonged to a partisan and he marked it twice for the 2 kills he had. Came from his family. _

### Spanish FR-8


This is a Spanish bayonet (I believe from the 1960s) for the [CETME](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CETME) rifle. I'm sure this weapon has a history, but what it is, I don't know, other that this is an issued example, where many that are seen today are new surplus.

### Chilean M1895


This is a rather interesting bayonet, partly for it's origin, and partly for its great condition. The is a German made bayonet for the [Mauser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauser) rifle, made by [Weyersberg Kirschbaum & Co.](http://www.military-swords.com/startweb.php) with a blade made at the infamous [Krupp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krupp) factory.
