There was a time when I had plenty of free time, and as such I decided to make good use of the great reseller web hosting account that I had (from RadicalV*, great company). Well, time went on and the free time went away.

SecServe is officially closed, while it's been down to only a couple customers for awhile, I feel it's time to cut my losses and close the doors. Thanks to all the people that used the services I offered, and to them, I'll offer my services free of change so long as I'm able.

Thanks guys. (If you are here looking for a good web host, try RadicalV*, you'll love 'em.)

**Update:** I can no longer in good conscience recommend RadicalV; they are simply too far behind the times and they've failed to keep too many promises. I'm currently using [HostingRails](http://www.hostingrails.com/home/1804899096 ); and so far I've been quite happy with them.
